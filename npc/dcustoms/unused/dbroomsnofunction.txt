// Change all to arguments in a callfunc

// EXAMPLE OF ARGUMENTS WHEN CALLING FUNCTION FOR ROOM 01
// callfunc "F_DBroom",1,.dbroom01,.temppassword01$,.password01$,.pass01$,.room01owner$,OnWarper01TimeOver,OnWarper1Warning,dbroom01;

// Here is a legend - this would not be present in the call or in the function, it is just easier to look at when typing up the function
// 1 = getarg(0)
// .dbroom1 = getarg(1)
// .temppassword1$ = getarg(2)
// .password1$ = getarg(3)
// .pass1$ = getarg(4)
// .room1owner$ = getarg(5)
// OnWarper1TimeOver = getarg(6)
// OnWarper1Warning = getarg(7)
// dbroom01 == getarg(8)

// Replace ^ with the getarg() lines and now we have one function using only arguments to provide n number of rooms
// The only thing that changes is the callfunc line
// Room 2 example:
// callfunc "F_DBroom",2,.dbroom2,.temppassword2$,.password2$,.pass2$,.room2owner$,OnWarper2TimeOver,OnWarper2Warning,dbroom02;
