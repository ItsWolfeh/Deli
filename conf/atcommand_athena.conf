//--------------------------------------------------------------
// eAthena atcommand configuration file.
// Originally translated by Peter Kieser <pfak@telus.net>
//--------------------------------------------------------------

// The symbol that will be used to recognize commands.
// You can set any one character except control-characters (0x00-0x1f),
// '%', '$' (party/guild chat speaking) and '/' (standard client commands).
// The symbol must also be different from from the GM charcommand symbol.
command_symbol: @

// The following settings in this file use the format "<command name>: level".
// They define the minimum GM level required to execute the associated command.
// Adjust values as you like. Note that to activate commands for normal players,
// (GM level 0), you also need to change the 'atcommand_gm_only' option to 'no'.
// To completely disable a command, set its required GM level to 100.

// Default levels were chosen so that they form the following hierarchy:
// 0: Normal player
//    -> no commands accessible
// 1: Super player
//    -> some minor advantage: storage, petrename, etc...
// 10: Super player+
//    -> more powerful commands, like mobsearch and changegm
// 20: Mediator
//    -> GM commands for finding players and moving to them (also kicking them)
// 40: Sub-GM
//    -> GM commands for basic tasks, no significant impact on other players
// 50: Sub-GM+
//    -> GM commands to spawn mobs and create guilds
// 60: GM
//    -> almost all commands available (except administration and mass commands)
// 80: GM Chief
//    -> can do anything, except administration commands
// 99: Administrator
//    -> can do anything!
// 100: Disabled
//    -> commands that will not be available to anyone
